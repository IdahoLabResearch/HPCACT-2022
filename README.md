# HPCACT-2022
The HPCACT-2022 dataset was created to help complement temporal action detection datasets by providing both normal
and anomalous activities where not all activities are human driven and where the same activity can be viewed from 
multiple camera angles and with varying levels of occlusion.  The HPCACT-2022 dataset incorporates elements from an
HPC datacenter setting where anomalies may arise from equipment or other non-human driven causes or an interaction
between multiple non-human driven causes.
